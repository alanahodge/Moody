Moody was inspired by current events, and how we've been connecting with others during these difficult times. While self-isolating due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we notice that like ourselves, many of our friends were struggling with their mental health. Feelings of loneliness, anxiety, depression, sadness and hopelessness seemed to be common. In an attempt to better connect with our friends and to help support each other, we wanted to create a simple way to check in with our loved ones and their feelings, to help to elevate our own moods as well as the moods of others.


## How It Works
Moody is an app designed for simple connectivity from one friend to another. Once you sign up for Moody, you can actively track your moods, emotions and feelings in the Mood Calendar by entering a quick and easy mood log. If Moody notices that you've been having several awful feelings or days, or that you haven't made a mood log in a while, moody will notify your friends so that they can reach out to you directly, connecting you to their support seamlessly.

Added features include a quote of the day feature and an average mood calculation as you continue to enter mood logs.
